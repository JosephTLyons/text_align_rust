# TODO

- Add documentation
- Clean up tests (remove redundant / unneeded ones, divide the up into more functions, etc)
- Better description? In repo, in toml, in README
- Potentially refactor right and center align functions?  They are pretty similar
- Less allocations everywhere, especially in `justify()`
- Investigate why some `if has_newline {}` blocks increment the width and some don't
- Strings with multiple newlines scattered throughout them
- Move TODOs into GitHub Issues
